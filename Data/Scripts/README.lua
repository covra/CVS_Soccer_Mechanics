The soccer ball
--------------

 - I have testing the ball and I added a template with the size and parammeters more realistics and playables I found.
 Linear and angular damping depend directly on the size of the ball. 
 Maybe, you can use these values as a base to make it rotate more or less, 
 or the game is faster or requires more control

The cones
---------

	- The cones have been added under client context to give them a bit of physics,
	so the debris parameters have been modified
